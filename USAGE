Usage instructions


   !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!!

   THIS APPLICATION IS NOT TO BE USED AS A MEAN TO INSURE FLIGHT SAFETY.

  Always follow official or recommended procedures to insure flight safety,
         *independently* from the help this application can offer.

  In particular, this application relies on barometric pressure to derive
  the altitude and WILL NOT WORK IN A PRESSURIZED AIRCRAFT.

  WARNING: This app is intended only as an in-flight aid and should not be
  used as a primary information source. This app contains a barometric
  altimeter, it will not function in a pressurized aircraft.

  WARNING: Blood Oxygen Saturation readings (SpO2) is intended only as an 
  in-flight aid, smartwatch sensors still have shortcomings that can limit
  the accuracy of the reading.

   !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!! DISCLAIMER !!! WARNING !!!


Getting Started
---------

Upon launch, the application automatically calibrates its raw pressure reading
to match the altitude detected by the watch. As such, if your watch supports maps,
it is a good idea to do a DEM Calibration at takeoff, prior to launching the app.
This is done outside of the app in the watch Settings -> Sensors and Accessories
-> Altimeter -> Calibrate -> Use DEM.

Otherwise, you will need to manually calibrate the altitude after launching GlideApp,
as detailed in the Settings section.

After launching the app, if you're confused that the app is not displaying any
data, don't fret! You just need to get a GPS fix :) Go to a window or go outside,
and all will become clear.

Next is navigation. The app is geared towards watches that can be used without
a touch interface, such as Forerunner or Fenix series.

Up button (middle left) and Down button (bottom left) can be used to go from one
view to another. Swiping up and down on a touchscreen also does the trick.

Long pressing the Up button will bring up the menu (except in the Varioplot view!
See the rest of this doc to learn more). You can navigate the menu and its various
settings with the Up, Down, Select (top right button) and Back (bottom right)
buttons. Swipes and taps also work. Check the settings and set them to what you like!

The Select button can be used to start and stop the activity recording, and Back can
be used to exit the app (except in the Log view).

Foreword
--------

GlideApp relies on your device's raw barometric sensor to compute the altitude,
using the ad-hoc International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) formulas and
according to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).

Upon startup, the application will read the watch altitude (if available) and
calibrate its barometer based on that. If the watch altitude was correct, then
everything is fine, and no further calibration is needed.

If, however you are unsure that your watch altitude is correct, or you know the
exact altitude of takeoff better than the watch does, you should calibrate My
Vario internal altimeter - using either the known QNH or elevation (see Settings
below) - to obtain an accurate altitude reading (besides the initial automated
calibration, the device's "native" altimeter/barometer settings are ignored).

GlideApp is based on My Vario Lite by Yannick Dutertre and the excellent
GliderSK by Cedric Dufour. If you like this application, you should consider
donating to him (see DONATE file or below).

A lot of this USAGE text is also verbatim from Cedric's manual.

Header
------

The Header, visible in all views (except in the Variometer view) displays the current battery 
level, GPS signal level, and activity status (Stanby, Paused or Recording). 

Also in the header view it is displayed a color status indicator for the current status of the 
Blood Oxygen Saturation reading:
  - color indicaction for SpO2 levels: >=95 green, 90-95 yellow, <=90 red flashing
  or reading age takes precedence for lower status color:
  - readings less than 6 minutos old: green, 6-20 minutes old: yeloow, over 20 minutes: red.
  - red/blinking when SpO2 value equal or below the set up Critical level.

Footer
------

The Footer, visible in all views (except in the Variometer and Log views) displays the current 
time (Local Time or Zulu UTC). Each time the App view is changed the Elapsed Time (since the 
activity started recording, including paused periods) is displayed for 10 seconds.

General Views
-------------

The GlideApp General view displays all the flight data in a single view, without
any further bells or whistles:

General View 1
 - Top-Left:
   heart rate reading
 - Top-Right:
   - Blood Oxygen Saturation reading (when available, it may take same time to get a reading)
   - age of last SpO2 reading (readings are taken when age is over 5 minutes)
   When set up as enabled above caution elevation it shows "elev" and caution elevation 
   over wich the pulse oximeter will be active.
   When SpO2 value is equal or below the set up Critical level, the background of this 
   field turns red.
 - Left:
   your current altitude (altitude label will be orange on devices with no barometric sensor,
   and will use GPS altitude)
 - Center:
   your current finesse
 - Right:
   your current (GPS) heading
 - Bottom-Left:
   your current vertical speed
 - Bottom-Right:
   your current ground speed

General View 2
 - Top-Left:
   estimated wind direction (when available)
 - Top-Center:
   wind arrow in heading up mode, displays where wind is coming from relative to our 
   forward vector (once wind dir is computed)
 - Top-Right:
   estimated wind speed (when available)
 - Left:
   your current altitude (altitude label will be orange on devices with no barometric sensor,
   and will use GPS altitude)
 - Center:
   your current finesse
 - Right:
   your current (GPS) heading
 - Bottom-Left:
   your current vertical speed
 - Bottom-Right:
   your current ground speed

Variometer View
---------------

The GlideApp Variometer displays your current ascent/descent rate both textually 
and graphically, using visually appealing colors:
 - GREEN for ascent
 - RED for descent

The textual display shows the average vertical speed for a selectable time span
(10, 20 or 30 seconds), or the current data. 

Graphically the current vertical speed is shown with the main needle moving along 
the range strip (tracking altitude variation only dAlt). You can also select 
(see Settings) to display a secondary needle for kinetic energy (speed) compensated 
variations (dE), compensating pure altitude variations with exchance of speed into 
altitde (kinetic into potential energy) and vice versa. An efficiency of 90% is used 
for energy conversions alongside with GPS derived ground speed.. so this is an 
aproximation to a real Total Energy variometer as no real air speed can be used.

Additionally a green T bug indicator is also displayed graphically showing the 
average vertical speed for the last thermal or the average for the last n seconds 
(average time selected).

There is a secondary inner strip that shows the min and max acceleration (g) 
readings, the min-max range is shown in yellow. The current g load is shown with a 
red diamond indicator in the main strip.

Once an activity is being recorded, you can change the variometer range by pressing
the back button.

Varioplot / Thermal Assistant View
----------------------------------

The GlideApp Varioplot / Thermal Assistant graphically displays you ascent/descent
rate along your flight path, using visually appealing colors ranging from:
 - (Bright) GREEN for maximum ascent rate
 - (Bright) RED for maximum descent rate

Unless configured otherwise, the screen will automatically switch to this view
when circling is detected, and switch back to previous view once circling is no
longer detected.

In addition, the following values will be displayed in the corner of the plot:
 - Top-Left:
   your current altitude. The color of this number indicates how much altitude
   has been gained (or lost) within the last 20 seconds: green for gains, red
   for loss, grey for (relatively) unchanged. This can be very useful in weak
   thermals. If circling is detected, it will show current circling duration
   and height gain (or loss).
 - Center-Top:
   compass north arrow in heading up orientation
 - Top-Right:
   your current vertical speed
 - Left:
   wind direction and speed (when available)
 - Bottom-Left:
   your current ground speed
 - Bottom-Right:
   your current finesse and plot scale

If turned on, the current thermal detected core will be displayed as a blue circle.
See "About Thermal Detection" for more details.

The App calculates wind direction and speed using the displacement of multiple circles when 
circling, the calculated values can be affected when a pilot tries to center a thermal and 
intentionally modifies the circling patern.

Varioplot can be configured in settings to be show as north up or heading up.

By pressing the SELECT button, you will enter the Zoom mode, where short pressing the 
Up & Down buttons will result in zoom in and out (previous versions used the MENU button, 
changed to match the one used by the Map View, so there is no Start/Pause/Save/Discard menu 
available here).

By pressing the MENU button (long-pressing the UP button), you will enter the Settings menu.

Map View
--------

The GlideApp Map view displays a moving Map tracking your current position moving over the 
maps enabled in your device, so it is not available for devices with no mapping features. 
You can select to display/not display this moving map in the Settings menu (default is off).

As this view uses the built in map feature, it uses the watch device settings for the display 
options such as track North Up/Heading UP or Zoom options, so the settings for varioplot 
view have no effect on the map view and are completly independent for both views.

If you want to change a map option you have to do so on the watch settings/map menu. Only Zoom 
can be changed in the Map view by pressing SELECT button (Zoom/Pan mode) so there is no 
Start/Pause/Save/Discard menu available in the Map View.

In GlideApp you can toggle via setting menu if you want to display/not display the Header
and Footer info and/or the flight data.

Timers View
-----------

The GlideApp Timers view displays the start and elapsed times, distance, ascent measures
since the (last) activity recording was started (see Activity Recording below)
 - flight time does not consider paused time when activity is paused

If enabled the center area displays a chart with data over time for selectable variables:
  - Altitude
  - Ascent (total)
  - Climb Rate
  - Speed
  - Heart Rate
  - Acceleration (g)
The variable displayed can be changed by pressing the back button or in the Settings menu.

When needed, the X and Y axis will automatically expand.

Chart display is on by default, can be turned off in settings General tab. When chart 
display is on, a new Chart tab in Settings is available where you can configure the
different options (see Chart in Setup below for more details).

On activity save, the view automatically goes to Timers page for the user to review last 
activity statistics, the chart cycles automatically through all variables (if enabled) 
every 5 seconds. 

In review mode Select button offers actions: 
  - done - exits the app 
  - back - goes back to normal app mode maintaining last activity data in Timers view 
  - clear - goes back to normal app mode claering last activity data in Timers view 
  
Back button no longer cycles through chart variables (if enabled) in this review mode, 
it exits the app. Using Select button and back or clear options brings back the back 
button normal functionality. 

Log View
--------

GlideApp Log view keeps track of your last recorded activities (global session
details; see Activity Recording below).

Use the SELECT and BACK buttons to browse through the last 100 saved entries (date of 
log is shown in the Footer).

The Log view is not available in flight (while recording) can only be accesed after 
starting the App or after saving/discarding an activity.

Info View
---------

GlideApp Info view shows different data for teh current location, as so it needs to have a location fix and can be accesed via setting Menu/Info selection.

The data displayed (when connected to a mobile device with internet connection) is:
  - Current location in Latitude and Longitude
  - Sunrise & Sunset times for current position (local time)
  - Civil Twilight times (begining/ending corresponding to the respective sunrise/sunset)
    (local time, works up to 60 ° lat)
  - Weather info for current location (provided by Garmin Weather), displaying:
    - current temperature
    - High/Low temperatures forecasted
    - current wind (speed/direction) in the closest weather station used by the provider
    - chart display with the forecasted temperature for the next 12 hrs

Activity Recording
------------------

Controlling your activity recording status (start, pause, resume, save, discard)
is achieved by pressing the SELECT button.

GlideApp adds custom fields to the recorded FIT file:
  - Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2, 0 value when no valid reading)
  - Barometric Altitude
  - Vertical Speed
  - Acceleration (g)
  - Rate of Turn
(which will be plotted in Garmin Connect IF your installed the application
 through the Garmin ConnectIQ store)

For the entire recording session, Garmin Connect will also show the following details:
  - Distance: non-thermalling distance
  - Ascent: cumulative altitude gain and elapsed time spent ascending
  - Minimum Altitude: value and time
  - Maximum Altitude: value and time

On activity save, the view automatically goes to Timers page for the user to review last 
activity statistics, the chart cycles automatically through all variables (if enabled) 
every 5 seconds. 

In review mode Select button offers actions: 
  - done - exits the app 
  - back - goes back to normal app mode maintaining last activity data in Timers view 
  - clear - goes back to normal app mode claering last activity data in Timers view 
  
In this review mode Back button no longer cycles through chart variables (if enabled), 
it exits the app. Using Select button and back or clear options restores the back 
button normal functionality. 

!!!! ABOUT ALTITUDE RECORDING !!!!

Note that Garmin doesn't allow applications to overwrite default FIT fields, and as such
there will be two Altitude fields in the generated activity log: the Garmin "official"
altitude, and our (better) barometric altitude field. By default, Garmin watches
attribute pressure changes to either weather or altitude changes. This can cause the
official altitude field to be wildly incorrect compared to our barometric altitude field.

If exporting your log to gpx format and uploading to Ayvri, the Garmin altitude field will
be used (unfortunately), and this can lead to some funky issues. It is thus better to set
the altimeter to Altimeter only in the watch settings before using the application.

This can be done in Settings -> Sensors & Accessories -> Altimeter -> Sensor Mode ->
Altimeter Only.

About Data Filtering
--------------------

GlideApp uses a Kalman Filter for Altitude and Vertical Speed. The filter
was derived from implementations in the SkyDrop vario and Arduino Open Vario.

Other values are not filtered.

The filter currently doesn't use data from the accelerometer, as gyroscope data 
is not yet available from the Garmin SDK. I am planning on adding this for System 5
devices, once SDK 4.1.0 comes out of Beta.

In general, filtered values are used.

Smoothing relies on the standard deviation of the Altitude (which depends on the
barometric sensor). This can be changed via the Variometer Smoothing setting.
Higher values of smoothing induce more lag - however, this still seems to be to
provide better reactivity for the same amount of smoothing as the original
simple moving average of GliderSK.

Note that the Minimum Climb setting can be used to compensate for weaker smoothing,
if using GlideApp as an audio/vibration variometer.

However, the Activity Recorded (FIT) data are always instantaneous rather than smoothed.

About Thermal Detection
-----------------------

Thermal detection can be enabled in the settings menu, under Variometer. This performs the
following across the last 60 seconds of location and variometer data:
- It assigns a weight to each location. The stronger the climb at that location the higher
  the weight. However, it also decreases the weight the further that point is from the current
  altitude. The older the data point, the lower its weight as well.
- Locations with a climb rate of less than the Min. Climb setting are ignored
- It computes the weighted average of the coordinates and uses that as the thermal center
- It computes at the same time the weighted standard deviation of the coordinates and uses
  that as the radius of the thermal
- It then draws the thermal as a circle in blue on the varioplot

This feature is experimental, and could be completely useless. Use at your own risk.
If you have a better algo in mind, please let me know!!

About touchscreen models (no 5 button control)
----------------------------------------------

This application has been made to support some touchscreen models. However, use of those models 
can be confusing, and the watches don't provide alert tones, so there are no vario tones, only 
vibrations. However some approximation of vario tones can be made using system sounds (check 
Settings -> Sounds -> Sound Driver). (bug tracker). This guide still applies, however the 
controls are different.

The Back button is unchanged (bottom right) and can be used to change settings.
The UP and DOWN buttons (middle left and bottom left on 5 button watches) are replaced by 
SWIPE UP and SWIPE DOWN gestures on the screen.
The START button (top right on 5 button watches) is replaced by a tap on the screen, so can be 
used to validate settings changes, start/stop and activity, etc.
This can become particularly counterintuitive when changing zoom and pan in the thermal 
assistant/varioplot view, but it works. Log view is a bit weird as well since to scroll through 
the logs, the back button and tap on screen commands are used, while swipe up/swipe down bring 
to the other watch screens.

WARNING!!! GOTCHAS!!!
---------------------

When using GPS devices, you should be aware that:
 - GPS is very accurate for location (latitude/longitude) information;
   even more so when coupled with GLONASS (at the cost of battery usage).
 - (Garmin) UltraTrac feature is very cool to save battery but does NOT
   refresh location information frequently enough for GlideApp purpose.

      !!! DO NOT USE ULTRATRAC WITH GlideApp !!!

The ConnectIQ framework does NOT allow applications - like GlideApp - to
control the location source (GPS, GLONASS and/or UltraTrac). The only way
to circumvent that limitation is to

      !!! USE A NATIVE GARMIN APPLICATION BEFOREHANDS !!!

The ConnectIQ application launched afterwards will then retain those settings.
